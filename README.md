# Portal-Weekly-Planner-20-21
Weekly planner made on LaTeX themed on portal

Designed to be printed on A5 paper, it covers the months in between October20 to July21.

In order to add more months, simply duplicate the corresponding files and re-type the days.

Pretty clean but begginer-level coding, it has a huge margin for improvements/autogeneration for future planners.
